Here are 7 tips to improve multi-agent systems:  
🧩 Design modular agents with specific, well-defined roles and tasks for simpler debugging.  
🎯 Use few-shot examples in prompts to clarify expected task and role behavior.  
🗣️ Design structured conversation flows to guide agent interactions.  
✅ Implement (self-)verification steps for agents to check their reasoning.  
🤝 Implement cross-verification mechanisms for agents to validate each other.  
❓ Design agents to proactively ask for clarification when needed.  
📜 Define structured conversation patterns and termination conditions.
