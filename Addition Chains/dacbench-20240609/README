To run benchmarks and draw graphs for selected primes under 10000:

    ./bench.py 10000 > bench.out
    ./plot.py < bench.out

Results are in plot*.pdf. The plotting relies on python3-matplotlib. To
instead select primes under another integer N, change 10000 to N.

bench.py automatically uses all available threads. To limit it to 1
thread:

    env THREADS=1 ./bench.py 10000 > bench.out

To plot only the mitm algorithm:

    grep -w mitm bench.out | ./plot.py

Miscellaneous tests:

    for x in gcd primes dac ladder cfrc prac sibc ctidh prune mitm mitm2
    do
      python3 $x.py > $x.out
    done
